<h2>Programming Project 4</h2>
<h3>Due Monday, April 15 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p><em><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Read the
<strong>Do's and Dont's</strong>
in the <strong>Course Honor Policy</strong> found on the Canvas class site. </em>
</p>


<h3>I. Overview</h3>

<p>The purpose of this project is to practice using linked lists, generic types, and iterators.</p>


<p><strong>New Guidelines For This Project</strong>
<ul>
<li>You need to use the generic types correctly.  There should be no warnings when compiling your code.  (There will be a penalty if you make the grader's compiler
suppress warnings!)</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You may use any of the <tt>LinkedList</tt> classes we created in lecture or lab.  You should
<em>not</em> use the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class from the API because you need to add a method to the class, and the API class 
does not give you (easy) ability to do that.  For the array, you may use a &quot;normal&quot; array or <tt>ArrayList</tt> from the API.
You must use the classes appropriately! That means, you must you the <tt>ArrayList</tt> as if it were an array and the <tt>LinkedList</tt> as a linked list.
If you write code for the linked list as if it were an array (for example, accessing elements at specific indexes), you will lose points.  Likewise, you will lose points if you treat an <tt>ArrayList</tt> as a linked list.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<hr />

<h3>II. Code Readability (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>To receive the full readability marks, your code must follow the following guideline:
<ul>
<li>All variables (fields, parameters, local variables) must be given appropriate and descriptive names.</li>
<li>All variable and method names must start with a lowercase letter.  All class names must start with an uppercase letter.</li>
<li>The class body should be organized so that all the fields are at the top of the file, the
constructors are next, the non-static methods next, and the static methods at the bottom with the main method last.</li>
<li>There should not be two statements on the same line.</li>
<li>All code must be properly indented (see Appendix F of the Lewis book for an example of good style).
    The amount of indentation is up to you, but it should be at least 2 spaces, and it must be used
    consistently throughout the code.</li>
<li>You must be consistent in your use of {, }.  The closing } must be on its own line and indented
the same amount as the line containing the opening {.</li>
<li>There must be an empty line between each method.</li>
<li>There must be a space separating each operator from its operands as well as a space after each comma.</li>
<li>There must be a comment at the top of the file that <strong>is in proper JavaDoc format</strong> and
includes both your name and a description of what the class represents.  The comment should include tags for the author.  (See Appendix J of the Lewis book of pages 226-234 if the Evans and Flanagan book.)</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each method (including constructors) that <strong>is in proper JavaDoc format</strong>
 and states <em>what</em> task the method is doing, not how it is doing it.  The comment should include
 tags for any parameters, return values and exceptions, and the tags should include appropriate comments
 that indicate the purpose of the inputs, the value returned, and the meaning of the exceptions.</li>
<li>There must be a comment directly above each field that, in one line, states what the field is storing.</li>
<li>There must be a comment either above or to the right of each non-field variable indicating what the variable is storing.  Any comments placed to the right should be aligned so they start on the same column.  Variables that are only used as an index in a loop do not need a comment.</li>
<li>There must be a comment above each loop that indicates the purpose of the loop.  Ideally, the comment would
consist of any preconditions (if they exist) and the subgoal for the loop iteration.</li>
<li>Any code that is complicated should have a short comment either above it or aligned to the right that
explains the logic of the code.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>III. Program Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You are to create JUnit tests. 
You are required to have a JUnit test class that tests the classes listed below.
You
need to provide a <em>separate</em> JUnit test class called <tt>LinkedListTester.java</tt> that tests the new routines you added to the 
<tt>LinkedList</tt> class.
You do not have to write tests for methods that you did not write.  For the non-linked list part of your code, it is your choice whether to have a single
JUnit test class or multiple test classes.</p>
<p>
Your report should be a short
document that explains why the JUnit tests you chose to do thoroughly test your program.  <strong>However</strong>, you should not JUnit test the <tt>main</tt> method
or methods that specifically
read from a file or methods that write to the screen.  
For these methods, your testing report should describe the tests you did to judge the correctness of your program.</p>

<hr>

<h3>IV. Java Programming (60% of your grade)</h3>


<p>Remember that in the homework, you will be writing JUnit test cases.  A <strong>strong</strong> recommendation is to write
your JUnit test cases <em>at the same time</em> as you complete each part of the program.</p>

<p>
Your project is to write routines that sort and collect a large collection of words.  A few years ago,
researchers counted the number of different words, how often each word was used, and the kinds of words used, by the
novelist Agatha Christie in each of her books: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.theguardian.com_books_2009_apr_03_agatha-2Dchristie-2Dalzheimers-2Dresearch&d=DwMGAg&c=76Q6Tcqc-t2x0ciWn7KFdCiqt6IQ7a_IF9uzNzd_2pA&r=yeUZYjtA30d6jBTRtiBSb_Ml-kf7avGVknymPXJbMmU&m=m6IOP_TU9EqqI8AmOYjeR_-Om8g8hG7hf_0URapw_as&s=OFPzOqGYu9UXIf_UB-HIai-FzwqsFMQky2GqzJV_LnI&e=">Study Claims Agatha Christie had Alzheimer's</a> .
You will do a similar counting of words in a text.

</p>

<h4>Very Important Programming Rules</h4>

<ul><li><p>The main purpose of this project is to gain practice using linked lists and arrays.  You have your choice of whether you want to use arrays or the <tt>ArrayList</tt> class from the API, and whether you
want to use the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class from class or the <tt>DoubleLinkedList</tt> class you will see in the next prelab and lab.
</p>

<p>You must use arrays and <tt>ArrayList</tt> explicitly as arrays.  Therefore you may not use the automatic resize feature of <tt>ArrayList</tt>, but you must instead set its initial capacity appropriately.</p>

<p>You must use the linked list explicitly as a linked list.  You may not use code that is inefficient in a linked list <em>even if the Java API optimizes that code</em>.
Therefore, you can not access a linked list element by its index nor request the <tt>size</tt> of the list.  Instead, you may use methods like adding and removing from the ends, testing if a list is empty, or using an iterator for the list.  Similarly,
if you are using our double linked list, you should not use or add inefficient helper methods. </p>
</li>

<li>The second purpose of the class is to use generic types appropriately.  Your code should not generate any warning messages when compiled.  (If you are not using DrJava, be sure to have it set so your IDE shows generic type warnings.)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>What you are to do</h4>
<p>You may add any classes or methods to the following as you see fit in order to complete the given tasks.</p>

<ol><li><p>Modify the <tt>LinkedList</tt> (or <tt>DoubleLinkedList</tt>) class and add a method <tt>append</tt>.  <tt>append</tt> should take another <tt>LinkedList</tt> (<tt>DoubleLinkedList</tt>) as input and append that list to the end of <em>this</em> list.  The append method should work by doing a few "arrow" adjustments on the boxes and it should <em>not</em> loop through the input list to add elements one at a time.</p></li>

<li><p>Create a class <tt>WordCount</tt> that stores a <tt>String word</tt> and an <tt>int count</tt>.  It should have the ability
to retrieve the word and change the count.  When you initialize a <tt>WordCount</tt>, you should specify the <em>word</em> and the
<em>count</em> should start at 1.</p></li>

<li><p>Create a class called <tt>TextAnalyze</tt>.  The class should have the following methods:
<ol><li><p><tt>radixSort</tt> is a static method that takes a linked list storing <tt>WordCount</tt> and returns a linked list
storing <tt>WordCount</tt>.  The input list can be assumed to contain only "words" that are strings of English letters.  The words
can be in any order, and the counts can be anything.  The output list will have the words in alphabetical order, each word will
appear exactly once, and the count for a word in the output list will be equal to sum of all the counts of that same word in the 
input list.  You are to sort the list using <em>radix sort</em> because that is the most efficient way to sort a large number 
of English words.  See below for the exact algorithm.</p> 
<p>Please also see below for a way to adjust your sort so that it efficiently removes duplicate words from the list.  <em>Do not</em>
try to remove duplicates by searching a list to see if the word is already there.  That is much too slow when repeated over
all the words in a large book.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>loadFile</tt> is a static method that takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a linked list of <tt>WordCount</tt>.
The input string is a file name.  The routine should open the file, and read every word in the file sequentially (a word is defined
as consecutive English letters), and for each word, create a <tt>WordCount</tt> object for that word with the count equal to 1.
The <tt>WordCount</tt> object should be added to a linked list, and the linked list is returned.  The method should throw an
appropriate exception if the file does not exist or cannot be read.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>writeData</tt> is a static method that takes a <tt>String</tt> and a linked list of <tt>WordCount</tt> as input.  The
string is the name of a file that should be created.  The routine will create the file, and then write each entry of the linked list
to the file on a separate line.  The line should have three values: the word of the <tt>WordCount</tt>, the count of the <tt>WordCount</tt>, and the percent that the word appears in the linked list (the percent is the count of the word divided by the sum of all the counts in the list).  The method should throw an appropriate exception if the file cannot be opened or if the file already exists (so you do not accidentally overwrite an important file on your computer).</p></li>


<li><p>Create a <tt>main</tt> method.  The main method should expect to command line arguments:<br />
<tt>java TextAnalyze inputFile outputFile</tt><br />
The first argument is the input file.  The program should open this file and read in all the words of that file.
The second argument is the output file.  The program should write to the output file: each word of the input file (in alphabetical order), how often that word appeared in the input file, and the percent that word was used (the number of times the word appeared divided by the total number of words).  
If the program succeeds, an appropriate message should be printed.  If there is an error, an appropriate message should be printed.
The program should not crash.</p></li></ol></p></li>

<li><p>As you may notice, you will be doing a lot of loops with your linked list.  It is your choice on which type of loop to use,
but you will probably find it simplest to make the linked list <tt>Iterable</tt>, as described in class later this week.</p></li></ol>

<h4>The radix sort algorithm</h4>

<p>The radix sort algorithm is the fastest way to alphabetize a list of words if the number of words is large.
For this, you need an array of 27 linked lists.  The linked lists will be for values 'a' through 'z' plus 'blank', and each
list should start out empty.   Create a loop that runs through the indeces.  The loop should start at the largest index of the
longest word and work down to 0.  Let <em>index</em> be the current index you are considering in the loop.  There should be an inner loop that runs through all the words in the linked list in order.
If <em>index</em> character of the word is (upper or lower case) 'a', then place the word into the linked list for 'a'.  If <em>index</em> character 
of the word is (upper or lower case) 'b', then place the word into the linked list for 'b'.  And so on.  If the word does not have a character at <em>index</em> (because the word is too short), then place it into the linked list for 'blank'.  Once all the words
are in their lists, append all the lists together starting with the blank list, then the 'a' list, then the 'b' list, and so on.
Now, decrement the <em>index</em> and repeat the outer loop using the new list and resetting the array to again be 27 empty
linke lists.</p>

<p>Here is an example.  Suppose our list is initially: <em>cat, bit, cop, cap, be, car, dart, bat, cart</em>.  Since 4 is the length of 
the longest word, we will start at 3 and move down to 0.  We will place the words in order into the lists.  After the first round,
we have:
<pre>
"blank"  't'
------------
cat      dart
bit      cart
cop
cap
be
car
bat
</pre>
(Note: I am only showing the array entries in which the list is not empty.  For the other 25 array indeces not show, the array will
hold an empty linked list.)</p><p>
We append the lists in order, and the result is <em>cat, bit, cop, cap, be, car, bat, cart, dart</em>.
Then we repeat on index 2 and run through the list in order placing the words into our array of lists.  The array of lists is now:
<pre>
"blank" 'p'   'r'   't'
-----------------------
be      cop   car   cat
        cap   dart  bit
              cart  bat
</pre>
We append the lists in order, and the result is <em>be, cop, cap, car, dart, cart, cat, bit, bat</em>.
Then we repeat on index 1 and run through the list in order placing the words into our array of lists.  The array of lists is now:
<pre>
'a'   'e'   'i'   'o'
---------------------
cap   be    bit   cop
car
dart
cart
cat
bat
</pre>
We append the lists in order, and the result is <em>cap, car, dart, cart, cat, bat, be, bit, cop</em>.
Then we repeat on index 0 and run through the list in order placing the words into our array of lists.  The array of lists is now:
<pre>
'b'   'c'   'd'
---------------
bat   cap   dart
be    car
bit   cart
      cat
      cop
</pre>
We append the lists in order, and the result is <em>bat, be, bit, cap, car, cart, cat, cop, dart</em>.  Since we are done with all
the indeces, the algorithm is finished, and the list is in sorted order.
</p>

<p><strong>Important change</strong>: Each time you go to add a word to the linked list, if the word is already at the end of the list, instead of adding it, change the count of the word to be the sum of the count of the word already on the list and the count of the word you will add.  As a result, your list should never have <em>consecutive words</em> that are the same.</p>
